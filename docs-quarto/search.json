It is designed as a sandbox for quick tests: simple scripts, synthetic datasets and toy examples that link canopy reflectance, SIF and temperature to underlying biochemical and structural traits.\n\n\n\n\nConcept\n\n\nSandbox, not a full framework\n\n\nThe lab is not a full processing chain. It is a lightweight place to try ideas before moving them into larger tools or pipelines (e.g. project-specific repositories or operational code).\n\n\n\n\nScope\n\n\nLeaf → canopy → scene\n\n\nExamples focus on radiative transfer, trait sensitivity and scaling. Scripts can simulate reflectance, fluorescence and thermal signals for simple scenarios and compare them across stress conditions.\n\n\n\n\nTeaching\n\n\nSupport for exercises\n\n\nThe repository can host short exercises for students: parameter sweeps, index experiments, quick plots for slides and small notebooks illustrating model behaviour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2025 Virtual Biophysical Lab · Minimal sandbox for biophysical model experiments.\n\n\nSource repository:  Virtual Biophysical Lab"

It is particularly suited to study canopy stress, energy partitioning and fluorescence dynamics.\n\n\n\nSCOPEinR\n\n\nCoupled radiative transfer & energy balance\n\n\nSCOPEinR is an R package designed to implement the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy Fluxes (SCOPE) model, originally developed in MATLAB by Van der Tol et al. (2009) and extended by Yang et al. (2020). SCOPEinR enables users to simulate the interactions between radiation, vegetation canopies, soil, and the atmosphere within a single, coupled radiative transfer and energy balance framework.\n\n\nThe package powers the online RT-Simulator, offering a Shiny interface that allows users to simulate top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance, canopy temperature, and chlorophyll fluorescence emissions under variable meteorological and structural conditions. This makes SCOPEinR particularly useful for studying vegetation stress, energy partitioning, and photochemical efficiency.\n\n\nFor full intercomparison with other radiative transfer (RT) models, SCOPEinR can be used together with the ToolsRTM package, enabling parallel simulations across different RT formulations (leaf-level, canopy-level, and RTM-based flux retrievals).\n\n\nIn the Virtual Biophysical Lab, SCOPEinR can be used to:\n\n\n\nSimulate canopy fluxes, temperature, TOC reflectance, fluorescence (SIF), and energy balance.\n\n\nCompare environmental scenarios such as drought, heat stress, stomatal closure, or nutrient limitations.\n\n\nGenerate synthetic diurnal cycles for benchmarking against flux tower observations (e.g., GPP, LE, Rn).\n\n\nDrive forward simulations for evaluating radiative transfer parameterizations and machine learning inversion pipelines.\n\n\n\nThe SCOPEinR and ToolsRTM packages have been integrated into an online RT-platform (currently in testing) that provides real-time simulations and visualizations through an interactive interface.\n\n\nGitLab repositories: SCOPEinR package  Online RT-platform (Shiny RT-Simulator) \n\n\nNote: These modules are currently in the testing phase before public release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2025 Virtual Biophysical Lab · Minimal sandbox for biophysical model experiments.\n\n\nSource repository:  Virtual Biophysical Lab"
