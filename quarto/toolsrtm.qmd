<p class="section-intro">
The Virtual Biophysical Lab is designed to connect with existing R toolboxes for radiative transfer
modelling. The <strong>ToolsRTM</strong> package provides a comprehensive suite of models for simulating
leaf and canopy reflectance, including soil and atmosphere components.

  <h3>Leaf &amp; canopy radiative transfer</h3>

  <p>
    <strong>ToolsRTM</strong> is an R package designed to perform detailed simulations of leaf and 
    canopy reflectance using a wide suite of radiative transfer (RT) models. It operates across 
    multiple satellite spectral configurations and enables high-fidelity analysis of vegetation 
    biophysical and biochemical traits.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the <em>canopy level</em>, ToolsRTM includes models such as <strong>INFORM</strong>, 
    <strong>fourSAIL</strong>, and <strong>fourSAIL2</strong>, enabling the simulation of BRDF-sensitive 
    canopy reflectance under variable structural and illumination conditions.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the <em>leaf level</em>, the package integrates models such as <strong>PROSPECT</strong>, 
    <strong>Liberty</strong>, and <strong>FLUSPECT (B–Cx)</strong>, enabling simulation of pigment content,
    water, and dry matter effects on reflectance and transmittance.
  </p>

  <p>
    ToolsRTM also incorporates the <strong>SPART</strong> model for TOA simulations, integrating:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>BSM</strong> – soil reflectance</li>
    <li><strong>PROSAIL</strong> – canopy reflectance</li>
    <li><strong>SMAC</strong> – atmospheric radiative transfer</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The package includes the <strong>MARMIT</strong> model for bare-soil reflectance (400–2500 nm),
    implemented via <code>get.marmit1</code> and <code>get.marmit2</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    ToolsRTM provides access to eight reference soil and vegetation databases 
    used for model parameterisation and validation.
