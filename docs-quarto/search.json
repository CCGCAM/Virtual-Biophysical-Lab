It is particularly suited for studying canopy stress responses, energy partitioning, and fluorescence dynamics across environmental conditions.\n\n\n\nSCOPEinR\n\n\nCoupled radiative transfer & energy balance\n\nSCOPEinR is an R package implementing the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy Fluxes (SCOPE) model, originally developed in MATLAB by Van der Tol et al. (2009) and further extended by Yang et al. (2020). The package enables simulations of interactions between radiation, vegetation canopies, soil, and the atmosphere within a single, coupled radiative transfer and energy balance framework.\n\n\nSCOPEinR also powers the online RT-Simulator, providing a Shiny-based interface that allows users to simulate top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance, canopy temperature, and chlorophyll fluorescence emissions under variable meteorological and structural conditions. This makes the package particularly useful for analysing vegetation stress, energy partitioning, and photochemical efficiency.\n\n\nFor systematic intercomparison with other radiative transfer (RT) models, SCOPEinR can be used together with ToolsRTM, enabling parallel simulations across different RT formulations (leaf-level, canopy-level, and RTM-based flux retrievals).\n\n\nWithin the Virtual Biophysical Lab, SCOPEinR can be used to:\n\n\n\nSimulate canopy fluxes, temperature, TOC reflectance, fluorescence (SIF), and energy balance.\n\n\nCompare environmental scenarios such as drought, heat stress, stomatal closure, or nutrient limitation.\n\n\nGenerate synthetic diurnal cycles for benchmarking against flux-tower observations (e.g. GPP, LE, Rn).\n\n\nSupport forward simulations for evaluating RT parameterisations and hybrid machine-learning inversion pipelines.\n\n\n\nThe SCOPEinR and ToolsRTM packages are being integrated into an online RT-platform (currently in testing), providing real-time simulations and visualisations through an interactive interface.\n\n\nGitLab repositories: SCOPEinR package  Online RT-platform (Shiny RT-Simulator) \n\n\nNote: These modules are currently in a testing phase prior to public release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2025 Virtual Biophysical Lab · Minimal sandbox for biophysical model experiments.\n\n\nSource repository:  Virtual Biophysical Lab"
