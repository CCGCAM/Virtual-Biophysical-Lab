The Virtual Biophysical Lab is intentionally compact, yet it supports both
teaching-oriented activities and early-stage research prototyping. Typical
use cases include:

Teaching
:::

### Simple exercises

Short, self-contained scripts can be used for practical exercises on leaf and
canopy properties (e.g. LAI and chlorophyll effects), stress versus control
scenarios, or comparisons between simulated spectra and satellite sensor
bands. These examples are well suited for MSc-level courses and introductory
training.

Prototyping
:::

### Idea testing

The lab provides a lightweight environment to rapidly test new vegetation
indices, perform sensitivity analyses, or explore alternative inversion
strategies before integrating them into larger project repositories or
operational processing pipelines.

Communication

### Figures & mini-demos

Users can generate figures or small interactive demonstrations that illustrate
model behaviour, assumptions, and limitations for presentations, project
meetings, or internal documentation.
