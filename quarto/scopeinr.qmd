**SCOPEinR** provides an R interface to the SCOPE model, enabling coupled
simulations of radiative transfer, photosynthesis, and energy balance. It
is particularly suited for studying canopy stress responses, energy
partitioning, and fluorescence dynamics across environmental conditions.

### Coupled radiative transfer & energy balance

**SCOPEinR** is an R package implementing the *Soil Canopy Observation,
Photochemistry and Energy Fluxes* (SCOPE) model, originally developed in
MATLAB by Van der Tol et al. (2009) and further extended by Yang et al.
(2020). The package enables simulations of interactions between radiation,
vegetation canopies, soil, and the atmosphere within a single, coupled
radiative transfer and energy balance framework.

SCOPEinR also powers the online **RT-Simulator**, providing a Shiny-based
interface that allows users to simulate top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance,
canopy temperature, and chlorophyll fluorescence emissions under variable
meteorological and structural conditions. This makes the package
particularly useful for analysing vegetation stress, energy
partitioning, and photochemical efficiency.

For systematic intercomparison with other radiative transfer (RT) models,
SCOPEinR can be used together with **ToolsRTM**, enabling parallel
simulations across different RT formulations (leaf-level, canopy-level,
and RTM-based flux retrievals).

Within the Virtual Biophysical Lab, SCOPEinR can be used to:

- Simulate canopy fluxes, temperature, TOC reflectance, fluorescence
  (SIF), and energy balance.
- Compare environmental scenarios such as drought, heat stress, stomatal
  closure, or nutrient limitation.
- Generate synthetic diurnal cycles for benchmarking against flux-tower
  observations (e.g. GPP, LE, Rn).
- Support forward simulations for evaluating RT parameterisations and
  hybrid machine-learning inversion pipelines.

The SCOPEinR and ToolsRTM packages are being integrated into an online
**RT-platform** (*currently in testing*), providing real-time simulations
and visualisations through an interactive interface.
