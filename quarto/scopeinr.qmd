<strong>SCOPEinR</strong> provides an R interface to the SCOPE model, enabling coupled simulations of 
radiative transfer, photosynthesis and energy balance. It is particularly suited to study canopy stress,
energy partitioning and fluorescence dynamics.

  <h3>Coupled radiative transfer &amp; energy balance</h3>

  <p>
    <strong>SCOPEinR</strong> is an R package designed to implement the 
    <em>Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy Fluxes</em> (SCOPE) 
    model, originally developed in MATLAB by Van der Tol et al. (2009) and extended 
    by Yang et al. (2020). SCOPEinR enables users to simulate the interactions between 
    radiation, vegetation canopies, soil, and the atmosphere within a single, 
    coupled radiative transfer and energy balance framework.
  </p>

  <p>
    The package powers the online <strong>RT-Simulator</strong>, offering a Shiny interface that allows 
    users to simulate top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance, canopy temperature, and 
    chlorophyll fluorescence emissions under variable meteorological and structural 
    conditions. This makes SCOPEinR particularly useful for studying vegetation stress, 
    energy partitioning, and photochemical efficiency.
  </p>

  <p>
    For full intercomparison with other radiative transfer (RT) models, SCOPEinR can be 
    used together with the <strong>ToolsRTM</strong> package, enabling parallel simulations across 
    different RT formulations (leaf-level, canopy-level, and RTM-based flux retrievals).
  </p>

  <p>
    In the Virtual Biophysical Lab, SCOPEinR can be used to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Simulate canopy fluxes, temperature, TOC reflectance, fluorescence (SIF), and energy balance.</li>
    <li>Compare environmental scenarios such as drought, heat stress, stomatal closure, or nutrient limitations.</li>
    <li>Generate synthetic diurnal cycles for benchmarking against flux tower observations (e.g., GPP, LE, Rn).</li>
    <li>Drive forward simulations for evaluating radiative transfer parameterizations and machine learning inversion pipelines.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The SCOPEinR and ToolsRTM packages have been integrated into an online 
    <strong>RT-platform</strong> (<em>currently in testing</em>) that provides real-time simulations 
    and visualizations through an interactive interface.
