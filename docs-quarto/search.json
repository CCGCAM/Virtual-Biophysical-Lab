It is particularly suited to study canopy stress, energy partitioning and fluorescence dynamics.\n\n\n\nSCOPEinR\n\n\nCoupled radiative transfer & energy balance\n\n\nSCOPEinR is an R package designed to implement the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy Fluxes (SCOPE) model, originally developed in MATLAB by Van der Tol et al. (2009) and extended by Yang et al. (2020). SCOPEinR enables users to simulate the interactions between radiation, vegetation canopies, soil, and the atmosphere within a single, coupled radiative transfer and energy balance framework.\n\n\nThe package powers the online RT-Simulator, offering a Shiny interface that allows users to simulate top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance, canopy temperature, and chlorophyll fluorescence emissions under variable meteorological and structural conditions. This makes SCOPEinR particularly useful for studying vegetation stress, energy partitioning, and photochemical efficiency.\n\n\nFor full intercomparison with other radiative transfer (RT) models, SCOPEinR can be used together with the ToolsRTM package, enabling parallel simulations across different RT formulations (leaf-level, canopy-level, and RTM-based flux retrievals).\n\n\nIn the Virtual Biophysical Lab, SCOPEinR can be used to:\n\n\n\nSimulate canopy fluxes, temperature, TOC reflectance, fluorescence (SIF), and energy balance.\n\n\nCompare environmental scenarios such as drought, heat stress, stomatal closure, or nutrient limitations.\n\n\nGenerate synthetic diurnal cycles for benchmarking against flux tower observations (e.g., GPP, LE, Rn).\n\n\nDrive forward simulations for evaluating radiative transfer parameterizations and machine learning inversion pipelines.\n\n\n\nThe SCOPEinR and ToolsRTM packages have been integrated into an online RT-platform (currently in testing) that provides real-time simulations and visualizations through an interactive interface.\n\n\nGitLab repositories: SCOPEinR package  Online RT-platform (Shiny RT-Simulator) \n\n\nNote: These modules are currently in the testing phase before public release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2025 Virtual Biophysical Lab · Minimal sandbox for biophysical model experiments.\n\n\nSource repository:\n github.com/CCGCAM/Virtual-Biophysical-Lab"
