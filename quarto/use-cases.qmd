<p class="section-intro">
The Virtual Biophysical Lab is intentionally compact, yet it supports both teaching-oriented
activities and early-stage research prototyping. Typical use cases include:

### Simple exercises

Short, self-contained scripts can be used for practical exercises on leaf and canopy properties
(e.g. LAI and chlorophyll effects), stress versus control scenarios, or comparisons between
simulated spectra and satellite sensor bands. These examples are well suited for MSc-level courses
and introductory training.

### Idea testing

The lab provides a lightweight environment to rapidly test new vegetation indices, perform
sensitivity analyses, or explore alternative inversion strategies before integrating them into
larger project repositories or operational processing pipelines.

### Figures &amp; mini-demos

Users can generate figures or small interactive demonstrations that illustrate model behaviour,
assumptions, and limitations for presentations, project meetings, or internal documentation.
