<strong>SCOPEinR</strong> provides an R interface to the SCOPE model, enabling coupled simulations of
radiative transfer, photosynthesis, and energy balance. It is particularly suited for studying
canopy stress responses, energy partitioning, and fluorescence dynamics across environmental
conditions.

### Coupled radiative transfer &amp; energy balance

<p>
<strong>SCOPEinR</strong> is an R package implementing the
<em>Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy Fluxes</em> (SCOPE) model, originally
developed in MATLAB by Van der Tol et&nbsp;al. (2009) and further extended by Yang et&nbsp;al. (2020).
The package enables simulations of interactions between radiation, vegetation canopies, soil,
and the atmosphere within a single, coupled radiative transfer and energy balance framework.
</p>

<p>
SCOPEinR also powers the online <strong>RT-Simulator</strong>, providing a Shiny-based interface
that allows users to simulate top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance, canopy temperature, and
chlorophyll fluorescence emissions under variable meteorological and structural conditions.
This makes the package particularly useful for analysing vegetation stress, energy partitioning,
and photochemical efficiency.
</p>

<p>
For systematic intercomparison with other radiative transfer (RT) models, SCOPEinR can be used
together with <strong>ToolsRTM</strong>, enabling parallel simulations across different RT
formulations (leaf-level, canopy-level, and RTM-based flux retrievals).
</p>

<p>
Within the Virtual Biophysical Lab, SCOPEinR can be used to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Simulate canopy fluxes, temperature, TOC reflectance, fluorescence (SIF), and energy balance.</li>
  <li>Compare environmental scenarios such as drought, heat stress, stomatal closure, or nutrient limitation.</li>
  <li>Generate synthetic diurnal cycles for benchmarking against flux-tower observations (e.g. GPP, LE, Rn).</li>
  <li>Support forward simulations for evaluating RT parameterisations and hybrid machine-learning inversion pipelines.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The SCOPEinR and ToolsRTM packages are being integrated into an online
<strong>RT-platform</strong> (<em>currently in testing</em>), providing real-time simulations and
visualisations through an interactive interface.
