# HYDRA-EO Tutorials · Hybrid ML & RTM for crop stress

::: {.hero-text}
This tutorial site provides lightweight examples, scripts, and notebooks
that illustrate the main concepts of the **HYDRA-EO** project: hybrid
machine learning, radiative transfer modelling, and multi-sensor Earth
Observation for crop stress, pests, and disease monitoring.

## What are these tutorials?

The HYDRA-EO tutorial platform mirrors the structure of the main HYDRA-EO
project website, but in a lightweight scientific format. It provides a
sandbox where users can interact with radiative transfer models, explore
spectral simulations, test machine-learning workflows, and understand
how symptoms of crop stress emerge across spectral domains.

### Radiative transfer simulations

Hands-on examples using **ToolsRTM** (PROSAIL, INFORM, FLUSPECT, SPART,
MARMIT) and **SCOPEinR** for coupled radiative transfer, energy balance,
and fluorescence.

### Trait-based machine learning

Practical workflows showing how synthetic RTM libraries can support
supervised learning, stress differentiation, and band/feature selection
for ESA missions.

### Multi-sensor Earth Observation

Use cases combining UAV hyperspectral, thermal, airborne HyPlant, and
satellite data (Sentinel-2, PRISMA, EnMAP, FLEX-like SIF) to explore
scaling from leaf to landscape.
