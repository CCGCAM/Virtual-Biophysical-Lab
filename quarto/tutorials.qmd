## Virtual Biophysical Lab

This section provides the practical learning layer of the **Virtual
Biophysical Lab**. It gathers structured tutorials that translate the
scientific concepts, models, and workflows developed in **HYDRA-EO**
into reproducible, hands-on examples.

The tutorials are organised by core modelling packages used within the
project, primarily **ToolsRTM** and **SCOPEinR**, and are delivered as
executable notebooks and scripted workflows that can be directly run,
modified, and reused.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ToolsRTM package

The ToolsRTM tutorials introduce the foundations of radiative transfer
modelling and EO-based plant trait retrieval. They guide users through
leaf- and canopy-level reflectance simulations, spectral sensitivity
analysis and band selection, and the integration of radiative transfer
models with Earth Observation data. Emphasis is placed on hybrid
workflows that combine physically based models with machine-learning
approaches.

    sensitivity analysis, and hybrid RTM–ML workflows using the ToolsRTM

    STAC**](../notebooks/getting_satellite_using_stac.html)\
    *Practical tutorial on accessing and visualising EO satellite data
    using STAC APIs, designed to support downstream RTM-based analyses.*

## SCOPEinR package

The SCOPE tutorials focus on the simulation of coupled energy balance,
photosynthesis, and fluorescence processes at the canopy scale. They
demonstrate how SIF and thermal signals can be interpreted in relation
to underlying physiological processes, and how model outputs can be
validated against field measurements and flux-tower observations.

## Script-based tutorials (R)

These scripts provide reproducible, step-by-step examples that
complement the notebook-based tutorials. They are organised by modelling
framework and can be run independently or adapted for teaching and
prototyping.

[**Run with getSCOPE**](../scripts/1-getSCOPE.R)\ : Run a basic SCOPE simulation and extract core outputs.

[**Run with getSCOPE using

::: section-intro
These scripts focus on coupled energy balance, photosynthesis,
temperature, and fluorescence simulations, and are well suited for
understanding SCOPE dynamics before moving to hybrid or inversion
workflows.
