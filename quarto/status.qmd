<p class="section-intro">
The Virtual Biophysical Lab is currently in an early prototype phase. Its primary objective is to
provide a clean, low-friction environment for testing methodological ideas, hosting small and
reproducible examples for students and collaborators, and preparing content that can later be
migrated into more complete tools or project-specific repositories.
</p>

<p class="section-intro">
At this stage, the emphasis is on clarity, reproducibility, and pedagogical value rather than on
operational completeness. Interfaces, examples, and documentation may evolve rapidly as concepts
are validated, refined, and consolidated.
