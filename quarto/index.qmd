# HYDRA-EO Tutorials <span>· Hybrid ML &amp; RTM for crop stress</span>

<p class="hero-text">
This tutorial site provides lightweight examples, scripts and notebooks that illustrate the main
concepts of the HYDRA-EO project: hybrid machine learning, radiative transfer modelling and
multi-sensor Earth Observation for crop stress, pests and disease monitoring.

## What are these tutorials?

The HYDRA-EO tutorial platform mirrors the structure of the main HYDRA-EO project website, but in a lightweight scientific format.
It provides a sandbox where users can interact with radiative transfer models, explore spectral simulations,
test machine-learning workflows and understand how symptoms of crop stress emerge across spectral domains.

### Radiative transfer simulations

Hands-on examples using **ToolsRTM** (PROSAIL, INFORM, FLUSPECT, SPART, MARMIT)
and **SCOPEinR** for coupled radiative transfer, energy balance and fluorescence.

### Trait-based machine learning

Practical workflows showing how synthetic RTM libraries can support supervised learning,
stress differentiation and band/feature selection for ESA missions.

### Multi-sensor Earth Observation

Use cases combining UAV hyperspectral, thermal, airborne HyPlant, and satellite data
(Sentinel-2, PRISMA, EnMAP, FLEX-like SIF) to explore scaling from leaf to landscape.
