The Virtual Biophysical Lab is designed to connect with existing R
toolboxes for radiative transfer modelling. The **ToolsRTM** package
provides a comprehensive suite of models for simulating leaf and canopy
reflectance, including soil and atmosphere components.

### Leaf & canopy radiative transfer

**ToolsRTM** is an R package designed to perform detailed simulations of
leaf and canopy reflectance using a wide suite of radiative transfer
(RT) models. It operates across multiple satellite spectral
configurations and enables high-fidelity analysis of vegetation
biophysical and biochemical traits.

At the *canopy level*, ToolsRTM includes models such as **INFORM**,
**fourSAIL**, and **fourSAIL2**, enabling the simulation of
BRDF-sensitive canopy reflectance under variable structural and
illumination conditions.

At the *leaf level*, the package integrates models such as **PROSPECT**,
**Liberty**, and **FLUSPECT (B–Cx)**, enabling simulation of pigment
content, water, and dry-matter effects on reflectance and transmittance.

ToolsRTM also incorporates the **SPART** model for top-of-atmosphere
(TOA) simulations, integrating:

-   **BSM** — soil reflectance\
-   **PROSAIL** — canopy reflectance\
-   **SMAC** — atmospheric radiative transfer

The package includes the **MARMIT** model for bare-soil reflectance
(400–2500 nm), implemented via `get.marmit1` and `get.marmit2`.

ToolsRTM provides access to eight reference soil and vegetation
databases used for model parameterisation and validation.
