Getting started with the repository
:::

::: {.section-intro}
This section provides a minimal workflow to help you start using the
Virtual Biophysical Lab repository for learning, teaching, or
early-stage research prototyping.
:::

1. Clone the repository locally or download it as a ZIP archive.
2. Open the `notebooks/` or `rtm/` directories in your preferred IDE
   (e.g. RStudio, VS Code).
3. Run one of the introductory scripts and modify key parameters such as
   LAI, chlorophyll content (Cab), or soil brightness.
4. Visualise the outputs and compare results across scenarios, stress
   levels, or sensor configurations.
