<h1>Virtual Biophysical Lab <span>· Vegetation Remote Sensing</span></h1>

<p class="hero-text">
A minimal experimental environment for testing biophysical models used in vegetation
remote sensing. The lab hosts small scripts, notebooks and figures that explore how
leaf and canopy traits control optical, fluorescence and thermal signals – without
exposing personal information or depending on a heavy web framework.

<p class="section-intro">
The <strong>Virtual Biophysical Lab</strong> is a small, self-contained space for experimenting with
biophysical models applied to vegetation monitoring. It is designed as a sandbox for quick tests:
simple scripts, synthetic datasets and toy examples that link canopy reflectance, SIF and
temperature to underlying biochemical and structural traits.

  <h3>Sandbox, not a full framework</h3>
  <p>
    The lab is not a full processing chain. It is a lightweight place to try ideas before moving
    them into larger tools or pipelines (e.g. project-specific repositories or operational code).
  </p>

  <div class="pill-mini">Scope</div>
  <h3>Leaf → canopy → scene</h3>
  <p>
    Examples focus on radiative transfer, trait sensitivity and scaling. Scripts can simulate
    reflectance, fluorescence and thermal signals for simple scenarios and compare them across
    stress conditions.

  <h3>Support for exercises</h3>
  <p>
    The repository can host short exercises for students: parameter sweeps, index experiments,
    quick plots for slides and small notebooks illustrating model behaviour.
