The exact layout of the repository is intentionally flexible. The structure
below represents a lightweight organisation that works well for both teaching
exercises and rapid research prototyping.

Codes in R
:::

### `scripts/`

Basic radiative transfer examples using **ToolsRTM** and **SCOPEinR**, including
single-run scripts, parameter sweeps, and small lookup table (LUT) generators.
These scripts are intended for rapid experimentation, method testing, and
teaching, and can be run independently or used as building blocks for more
advanced workflows, notebooks, or Shiny applications.

Shiny apps
:::

### `apps/`

Interactive **Shiny applications** that link biochemical and structural plant
traits to simulated spectra. These apps are designed for rapid exploration of
model behaviour, and interactive teaching and prototyping. They allow users to
adjust key biophysical parameters in real time and visualise spectral and
physiological responses across different radiative transfer models.

Lookup tables
:::

### `LUTs/`

Lookup tables and input parameter files used to run different radiative transfer
and eco-physiological models within the Virtual Biophysical Lab. The LUTs
support multiple modelling frameworks, including leaf-, canopy-, and
top-of-atmosphere simulations (e.g. PROSAIL, INFORM, FLUSPECT, Liberty, SCOPE),
and are used to ensure reproducibility and consistency across scripts.

Notebooks
:::

### `notebooks/`

R or Python notebooks used for interactive exploration, teaching demonstrations,
and quick checks of model behaviour.

Figures
:::

### `assets/`

Logos, plots, and diagrams generated by the lab, designed for reuse in lectures,
presentations, or scientific papers.

Docs
:::

### `docs/`

Short notes, mini-tutorials, and descriptions of example scripts or exercises
intended for students and new users.
