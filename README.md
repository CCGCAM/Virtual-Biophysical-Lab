# Virtual-Biophysical-Lab
Virtual Biophysical Lab is a lightweight experimental space for testing, exploring, and demonstrating biophysical models used in vegetation remote sensing. This repository hosts simple prototypes, scripts, and visualizations related to radiative transfer modelling, plant trait simulation, and canopy reflectance analysis.
