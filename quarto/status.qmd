● Early prototype / sandbox
:::

::: {.section-intro}
The **Virtual Biophysical Lab** is currently in an early prototype phase. Its primary objective is to
provide a clean, low-friction environment for testing methodological ideas, hosting small and
reproducible examples for students and collaborators, and preparing content that can later be
migrated into more complete tools or project-specific repositories.
:::

::: {.section-intro}
At this stage, the emphasis is on **clarity**, **reproducibility**, and **pedagogical value** rather than
on operational completeness. Interfaces, examples, and documentation may evolve rapidly as concepts
are validated, refined, and consolidated.
